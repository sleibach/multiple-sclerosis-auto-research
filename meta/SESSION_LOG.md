# SESSION_LOG

Append-only V11 resume log. Newest entries may be at the bottom.

## 2026-06-04 00:22 CEST - V11 Session 1

Objective:

- Initialize the V11 resume backbone and resolve at least one unresolved
  supported disagreement cell.

Completed:

- Created `scripts/v11_update_matrix_state.py`.
- Created canonical matrix state:
  - `analysis/v11_matrix/disagreement_matrix.tsv`
  - `meta/MATRIX_STATUS.md`
  - `meta/NEXT_ACTIONS.md`
- Imported the frozen V10 supported-only matrix: `10` qualifying cells.
- Pre-filled V10-resolved rows:
  - Sjogren IFN/APC versus lipid-lysosomal split.
  - RA IFN/APC versus pregnancy.
  - RA treatment response versus pregnancy.
  - UC treatment response versus tissue repair as an axis-nonindependence
    artifact.
- Resolved `001_ulcerative_colitis_axis_01_ifn_apc_vs_axis_07_treatment_response`
  as `intervention_derived`; see `UC_STATIC_DYNAMIC_APC_DECOUPLING_V11.md`.
- Resolved `005_rheumatoid_arthritis_axis_08_tissue_repair_resolution_vs_axis_09_sex_hormonal_pregnancy`
  as `artifact`; see `RA_TISSUE_REPAIR_PREGNANCY_SCOPE_AUDIT_V11.md`.
- Wrote `CONVERGENCE_CHECK_V11_01.md`.

Current matrix:

- Total cells: `10`.
- Non-unresolved: `6`.
- Completion: `60.0%`.
- Unresolved: `4`.

Genetics access:

- `OPENGWAS_JWT` unavailable. Genetics execution remains blocked.

Next session first action:

- Read `meta/NEXT_ACTIONS.md`.
- Start with `006_ulcerative_colitis_axis_02_genetics_vs_axis_07_treatment_response`.
- If `OPENGWAS_JWT` remains absent, use existing supported published genetics
  evidence and document the coloc/local-rg limitation.

## 2026-06-05 14:41 CEST - V12 Session 1

Objective:

- Resolve the remaining supported disagreement matrix cells, prioritizing the
  genetics-involving cells under the V12 multi-tool triangulation standard.

Completed:

- Verified `OPENGWAS_JWT` status. It was not visible to this process, so new
  OpenGWAS/LDSC/HDL and cross-trait colocalization were not run.
- Queried the local knowledge index before starting the UC and Crohn genetics
  cells.
- Resolved `006_ulcerative_colitis_axis_02_genetics_vs_axis_07_treatment_response`
  as `intervention_derived`; see `UC_GENETICS_TREATMENT_DECOUPLING_V12.md`.
- Resolved `007_Crohn_disease_axis_01_ifn_apc_vs_axis_02_genetics` as
  `biological`; see `CROHN_IFN_APC_GENETICS_DECOUPLING_V12.md`.
- Resolved `008_Crohn_disease_axis_02_genetics_vs_axis_07_treatment_response`
  as `intervention_derived`; see
  `CROHN_GENETICS_RESPONSE_REPAIR_DECOUPLING_V12.md`.
- Resolved `009_Crohn_disease_axis_02_genetics_vs_axis_08_tissue_repair_resolution`
  as `intervention_derived`; see
  `CROHN_GENETICS_RESPONSE_REPAIR_DECOUPLING_V12.md`.
- Wrote `AXIS_DISAGREEMENT_FINDINGS_V12.md`.
- Wrote `CONVERGENCE_CHECK_V12_01.md`.

Current matrix:

- Total cells: `10`.
- Non-unresolved: `10`.
- Completion: `100.0%`.
- Unresolved: `0`.

Genetics access:

- `OPENGWAS_JWT` unavailable to this process. Genetics cells are supported by
  multi-tool triangulation using existing project evidence and published
  genetics, not robust coloc-grade.

Next session first action:

- Read `meta/NEXT_ACTIONS.md`.
- If `OPENGWAS_JWT` is actually visible, upgrade the UC/MS and Crohn/MS
  genetics cells with executable OpenGWAS/HDL/LDSC and cross-trait coloc.
- If it remains absent, extend the matrix into lower-grade/thin-axis cells.
