## Mission State

V12 completed the supported-cell axis-disagreement matrix that V11 made
resumable. V13 has started the genetics-axis robustification using the now
working OpenGWAS token from `.env`.

Methodology backbone:

- V8 lock: `ROADMAP_V8.md`, `MAP_METHODOLOGY_V8.md`, commit `9c2e548`.
- V9 lock: `ROADMAP_V9.md`, `MAP_METHODOLOGY_V9.md`, commit `df7c7de`.
- V10 roadmap: `ROADMAP_V10.md`.
- V11 resume backbone:
  - `meta/MATRIX_STATUS.md`
  - `meta/NEXT_ACTIONS.md`
  - `meta/SESSION_LOG.md`
  - `analysis/v11_matrix/disagreement_matrix.tsv`

## Current Matrix State

- Total qualifying supported disagreement cells: `10`.
- Resolved/classified cells: `10`.
- Completion: `100.0%`.
- Unresolved cells: `0`.

Status counts:

- `biological`: `4`.
- `artifact`: `2`.
- `intervention_derived`: `4`.

## OpenGWAS Access

OpenGWAS access works when `.env` is loaded explicitly. This shell does not
auto-load `.env`.

Verification command:

- `.venv/bin/python scripts/check_opengwas_access.py`

Verified on 2026-06-05:

- `/user`: HTTP `200`.
- POST `/gwasinfo` for `ieu-b-18`: HTTP `200`.
- POST `/tophits` for `ieu-b-18`: HTTP `200`.

Use OpenGWAS API v4 POST calls for `gwasinfo`, `tophits`, and `associations`.
Do not reuse old GET-style scripts.

## V13 Genetics Checkpoint

First-pass OpenGWAS coloc has been run for MS/UC/Crohn overlapping top-hit
regions.

High-H4 first-pass regions:

- MS-UC `1:200375242-201375897`, `PP.H4 = 0.9840`.
- MS-UC `5:39896425-40944986`, `PP.H4 = 0.9337`.
- MS-Crohn `10:80542475-81559335`, `PP.H4 = 0.9776`.
- MS-Crohn `17:40014201-41029835`, `PP.H4 = 0.9413`.

MHC windows in both UC and Crohn mostly favored `PP.H3 ~= 1`, meaning distinct
causal variants rather than simple shared causality.

Matrix grade decision:

- No genetics matrix cell is upgraded to robust yet.
- The current coloc is single-causal-variant and top-hit-window selected.
- Required next layers: genome-wide LDSC/HDL, MHC-excluded sensitivity,
  multi-signal coloc, and eQTL/pQTL causal-gene mapping.

## V14 Locus-Landscape Checkpoint

V14 added prior/effect-size sensitivity and local evidence joins over the V13
OpenGWAS coloc outputs.

Stable first-pass H4:

- UC `1:200375242-201375897`: nominal `PP.H4 = 0.9840`; minimum sensitivity
  `PP.H4 = 0.8591`.
- Crohn `10:80542475-81559335`: nominal `PP.H4 = 0.9776`; minimum sensitivity
  `PP.H4 = 0.8088`.

Nominal-H4-only:

- Crohn `17:40014201-41029835`: nominal `PP.H4 = 0.9413`; minimum sensitivity
  `PP.H4 = 0.6141`.
- UC/PTGER4 `5:39896425-40944986`: nominal `PP.H4 = 0.9337`; minimum
  sensitivity `PP.H4 = 0.5700`.

PTGER4 status:

- Alive and high priority because it is druggable and has local L2G/QTL-coloc
  support across Crohn/MS/UC.
- Not robust or intervention-grade because multi-signal coloc and therapeutic
  direction are unresolved.

Tool status:

- R `coloc` 5.2.3 and `susieR` 0.14.2 are installed and smoke-tested.
- PyPI `ldsc` 2.0.1 is installed; CLI/help and toy munge smoke tests pass.
- Full LDSC/HDL genetic correlation remains blocked on reference LD-score
  panel and weights provisioning, not on package installation.

Bounded SuSiE-coloc status:

- UC chr1 `1:200375242-201375897`: top-500 shared SNP subset, 485
  allele-aligned SNPs used, max `PP.H4.abf = 0.959324545654259`.
- Crohn chr10 `10:80542475-81559335`: top-500 shared SNP subset, 492
  allele-aligned SNPs used, max `PP.H4.abf = 0.958107919239886`.
- Interpretation: supports the stable first-pass H4 loci under a multi-signal
  model, but does not yet justify robust genetics-axis upgrade because
  genome-wide LDSC/HDL, full-region sensitivity, MHC controls, and causal-gene
  direction mapping remain incomplete.

## V12 Findings

Completed synthesis:

- `AXIS_DISAGREEMENT_FINDINGS_V12.md`

Resolved V12 cell reports:

- `UC_GENETICS_TREATMENT_DECOUPLING_V12.md`
- `CROHN_IFN_APC_GENETICS_DECOUPLING_V12.md`
- `CROHN_GENETICS_RESPONSE_REPAIR_DECOUPLING_V12.md`

Core V12 interpretation:

UC is the stronger gut-disease comparator for MS inherited risk, while both UC
and Crohn support downstream mucosal IFN/APC response-monitoring analogies.
Therefore, genetic transfer and treatment-response biomarker transfer must be
treated as different axes.

## Transfer-Validity Rule

MS-adjacent autoimmune mechanisms transfer by biological layer, not by disease
label.

- UC: best gut-disease comparator for inherited immune genetic risk, but not a
  direct baseline IFN/APC response-stratifier template.
- Crohn: weaker genetic comparator than UC, but useful for downstream mucosal
  inflammatory-state response-monitoring analogies.
- RA: useful as a pregnancy/postpartum timing comparator, not as a blood APC
  treatment-response comparator.
- Sjogren: useful for antigen-presentation comparison, not for matched
  lysosomal/APC lesion-rim or foamy-myeloid biology without stronger matched
  tissue evidence.

## Highest-Value Next Actions

1. Continue V14 from `GENETICS_AXIS_V14_LANDSCAPE_CHECKPOINT.md`.
2. Run bounded SuSiE-coloc on remaining V14 high-H4 candidates:
   UC chr5/PTGER4, Crohn chr17/STAT3-STAT5, and MHC H3 negative controls.
3. Provision reference LD-score panels before LDSC/HDL genetic correlation.
4. Resolve PTGER4 effect-allele-aligned QTL direction before causal-gene or
   intervention claims.
5. Rebuild independent tissue-repair axes where current repair evidence
   overlaps treatment-response evidence.
